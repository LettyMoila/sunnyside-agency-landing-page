## My process
I firstly completed the design with HTML then applied CSS to make my design more appealing. To make it responsive; i have made use of JS. Since i struggled to use CSS grid, i used article for the main body and it turned out perfectly fine. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS library

### What I learned

```
<section> made it easy to accomodate my image-header along with <a> links```

```html
div, artcle and other general tags assist in building the website structure
```

```css
. for class modifications referrence
# for single identification editing
* accommodates/affects everything
It basically makes the website design more appealing
It actually overpowers HTML
}
```

```js
creating validation functions using if-else statements
```
```See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Triggered when users place the cursor on responsive tags
```

### Continued development

I would love to work on the dropdown image, add some effects to it for more appeal.
Add more responsive pages.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for html, css and javascrpt features clear understanding. I really liked this platform and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://github.com/uzoway/sunnyside-agency-landing-page) - This is an amazing code which helped me construct the layout as i could not structure my tables well. It finally gave me a clear understanding of article and div. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. It makes it better to improve the code.
